        <h1>About Equa11y</h1>
        <p>The Equa11y extension is to help test a webpage for accessibility. It is designed to improve the efficiency of accessibility testing with various utilities.</p>
        <p>For any questions or to report any issues, please <a href="https://github.com/ntibbles/equa11y/issues">log them in the github repo.</a></p>
        <h2>Why is a utility 'Not Available'</h2>
        <p>The extension checks if the site can run some of the utilities during initialization. If something fails, the utility is 'Not Available'.</p>
        <p>We're always looking for help. If you're interested, would like a feature or just rant, reach out on <a href="https://github.com/ntibbles/equa11y/discussions/28" target="_blank">discussions page</a>.</p>
